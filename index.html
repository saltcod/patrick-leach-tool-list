<pre style="white-space: unset;"><br>  If you have questions about what the Stanley numbers are, you can<br>look the planes up on Blood&amp;Gore:<br><br>	http://www.supertool.com/StanleyBG/stan0.htm<br><br>  Sometimes, emails to/from me are vectored to some cyber black<br>hole, never reaching their destination. I answer all emails, so if<br>you haven't heard from me, your/my email is likely having high tea<br>in said black hole, never to be heard from, so please try again.<br><br>  Please email me prior to sending money so that you can be sure<br>the item is still up for grabs. Also, prices do not include shipping,<br>which is the amount that it takes to go from me to you via the US<br>Post Office.<br><br>  This list goes out to many people, normally on the first Monday<br>of the month (unless otherwise noted above). So, if you see something<br>you want, it's the quickest finger on the trigger that wins the duel.<br><br>  Some folks become upset that they miss out on a tool. I wish I had<br>lots of this stuff many times over so I can satisfy the demand, but <br>that is normally not the case. Some of it does have duplicates here,<br>and if so, I will state that in my reply to you.<br><br>  Also, due to the nature of selling over the wires, tools are sold<br>on a first come, first serve basis. The first person to say "I'll <br>take it", gets it. I have to operate this way as some will take a <br>few days to get back to me with their interest in a particular item,<br>and it's unfair to keep others waiting who are willing to buy the<br>item immediately.<br><br>  I reserve the right to correct typographical errors after the list<br>goes out. I rarely make them, but when I do they can be major ones.<br><br>  If you're the kind of person who puts a straightedge to the sole of<br>a #40, to check it for flatness, or who tosses a plane on a scale to<br>weigh it against what it states in the Stanley catalogs, you'll need<br>to take your business elsewhere. I'll wish you luck finding perfection<br>in something that was never made, nor intended to be, perfect. You guys<br>know who you are, and it's best for both of us that our paths not cross.<br><br>  Remember, you don't have to be a connoisseur (did I spell that<br>correctly) to shop here. You can be a wirehead, a metalhead, a zipper-<br>head, a propellerhead, a deadhead, a cokehead, or even a knuckle<br>dragging oaf, just like me, to shop here, as long as your dinero is<br>green.<br><br>  Thanks for shopping, and remember that no letters or words were <br>injured when writing this list...<br><br>  <a name="featured_tool_of_the_month"></a>

FEATURED TOOL OF THE MONTH<br>  ******** **** ** *** *****<br><br>  FT1  Rare Griffith's Patent brace-like wrench with crank to <br>       open/close jaws; the third one I know of, one of those<br>       is a true brace configuration, this one is half a brace<br>       frame for compact storage, it has a turned wooden head<br>       to rotate it; patented by Nathan Griffith on November 24,<br>       1885, he of Providence, RI, it proved to be a miserable<br>       flop; chuck has barely readable markings of it being<br>       patented and with the date; as found, it's an idea that<br>       was better left on the drawing board:<br><br>
